## User Expierence

My main goal in this project was to create a modern and aesthetically pleasing website that was easy to use and navigate through the site.
It was important that the user would find the site appealing and that they would find the information about myself quite easily, the flow of the site has to be all relative, take the images for instance they would match a flow that continues to complement each other.

My goal was to keep a clean and contemporary design, yet with the odd splah of colour, the web apps section's images has a lot of colours but this was neccessary in order to show a preview of the app that you would be going to, I beleave that the this does not take away from the overall design of the sites scheme, and it is evident that this needs to be that way.
