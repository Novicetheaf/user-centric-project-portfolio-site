# **Edmund O Callaghan Portfolio**

User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my portfolio website to present to prospective employers. 
The portfolio showcases 3 projects: HTML, CSS, js and jquery. 
a bit about myself, my coding skills, forms of contacting me in my footer, via email, github and linkedin, and via the navbar modal conact me box.

## User Experience

### User stories
Any emplyers viewing my portfolio site will want to see a showcase of work to date, in order to get a better understanding of my skills to date, by means of project work. The site itself will also play a major reflection on my skills in design, consistency, and technologies.

Any recruiters who visit my site will want to see if my skills and projects meet the requirments of any position they have or willl have available.

### Strategy
My main goal in this project was to create a modern and aesthetically pleasing website that was easy to use and navigate through the site.
It was important that the user would find the site appealing and that they would find the information about myself quite easily, the flow of the site has to be all relative, take the images for instance they would match a flow that continues to complement each other.

My goal was to keep a clean and contemporary design, yet with the odd splah of colour, the web apps section image's has a lot of colours but this was neccessary in order to show a preview of the app that you would be going to, I believe that the this does not take away from the overall design of the sites scheme, and it is evident that this needs to be that way.

### Scope
The scope of my portfolio site is to showcase the most important and relevant information regarding my skills, projects, and expierence, with this in mind the end-user would have a good idea as to where they should proceed next.

### Structure
Key aspects of my structured layout of the sites navigation header bar is that you can access all key elements of the site all of the time, as the navbar follows you as you scroll. This allows the user to conact me easily, and navigate easily. In the footer I have links to my linkedin, github repo, and email, this allows the user to conact me through several mediums.

### Surface
The silver, grey/black, and white colour scheme maintains a contemporary design, and a professional atmosphere, which is key for the targeted end-user.

## Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.4.1)

## Features

The site has a fixed navigation bar which allows the end-user to access the home link, about, web apps, skills and conact with quick succession regardless of where the user in currently positioned on site. This maintains ease of use and speed of use, which keeps the end-user happy that they can navigate through the site and not get confused as to what they should interact with in order to reach there desired location. It also prevents the user from becoming fustrated by having the navbar available all of the time, as opposed to having to scroll all the way back to the start.

My user story was clean and concise for my about me page I put in my most relevant expierence to date, which showcases the most important aspects that a recruiter, company etc would be looking for, this saves the user time, and gives them a snippet of who they are interested in, and this will, depending on the user and their requirments, peek the users interest, which is of course the most important aspect of any site.
The about me section is also responsive and the image background padding is removed using an at media query for tablet screens.

For my Web apps section, the goal was to showcase what I can do for a company, if given the chance. It shows clearly without even going into the code, what technologies I made use of per project. This is achieved by the description sections next to the images, which also give you a snipped of what to expect when you navigate to the web apps.
This section was made responsive both to mobile devices and Full HD Desktop screens. The padding on the right side of the web app images is removed for consistency of design using an at media query on mobile devices. The 4th images and description was placed in lue of a future web app that will be placed within this section, and also for the purpose of consistency of flow in design.

The Skills section is clear, simple and to the point, I had planned to add circle radius to the skills section but I would have ended up with too many circles on mobile devices and as its mobile first design, that wouldn't make sense. so I kept is clean and conicse.

For my conact me section I added a popup modal form, I also added conact me link icons on the footer section which is industry standard.
If you try submiting the conact me form without a name, email, or description you will be notified that all 3 of them are required.

## Features to Implement
In the future I would like to add another web app to the coming soon section in web apps. I would like to add script in order for the contact me section to send emails through to my email account on the modal conact me section.

### User stories
For my user stories testing, I had to put myself in the shoes of each end user, recruiters and employers.
As a recruiter or employer I want to find out with quick succession, whether this candidate has the required skills for the job spec and relevant experience. When you arrive at the site you are greeted with a professional concise website, this showcases good design, which is what the end-user is looking for. when you scroll down from the home page to about me you'll be given a brief description of my recent experience. In order to see some of my capabilities the user can go to the web apps section and they will get a feel for what I can do. The user can scroll further down to skills and see the most important and relevant skills I have to date.
With regards to the above mentioned user stories the outcome for this test was successful.

### Responsive Flow Testing: 

#### Expected outcome for Desktop(s):  
Elements spread to the edges of the page, and web apps sections images and paragraphs spread out and only stack once in two rows.

Site Remains responsive throughout all devices that were tested.

#### Expected outcome for Tablet(s):  
Elements behave the same as on latop, other then the images in web apps section become enlarged and take up an entire row, and the description for the web apps stack above the images. The divs for about me and skills section take up the full width of the screen, so the background images become cut from the side.
